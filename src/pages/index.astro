        <p class="m-paragraph m-margin">The thermal comfort models guiding most buildings are based on 1960s-era studies of college-aged men from northern Europe and America, 
          leaving out the needs of diverse populations. Designing for a single "average person" isn't equitable—because that person doesn't exist—yet buildings are still 
          cooled, heated, and ventilated as if they do. So, how can we better represent and design for an entire population?</p>

					<div class="brief-tab one-half column">
						<h3 class="h3-title">Explore, compare and spot issues instantly</h3>
						<p class="m-paragraph m-margin">Dive into any time period, compare conditions across spaces, and customize comfort parameters for focused insights.
              Leaderboards highlight the least comfortable areas, showing how often each space meets comfort standards—and how that's changing over time.
            </p>

				<!-- Feature two -->
				<div class="row product-brief-items">
					<div class="brief-tab one-half column">
						<h3 class="h3-title">Visualize patterns and variability</h3>
						<p class="m-paragraph m-margin">Dive deep into how your spaces perform throughout the week. 
              Atmos combines a heatmap—showing average temperature normalized to each day of the week—with a temperature variability box plot, so you can instantly spot when and where comfort fluctuates most. These visualizations make it easy to pinpoint recurring issues, highlight outliers, and identify HVAC inefficiencies.</p>

						<p class="m-paragraph m-margin">Go beyond day-to-day monitoring. Atmos helps you uncover long-term patterns in thermal comfort metrics. Track seasonal shifts,
               measure the impact of interventions, and make data-driven decisions to optimize your indoor environments over time.</p>

						<p class="m-paragraph m-margin">See thermal comfort zones for a wide range of people, not just the "average." Get actionable suggestions for faster, more responsive systems and give occupants more control. 
              Integrated widgets let employees share real-time feedback and receive personalized, context-aware suggestions—making comfort a conversation, not a top-down decree.
